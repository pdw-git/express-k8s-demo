For testing of Mongo use a docker image

   docker pull mongo
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo

   Connection: mongodb://localhost:27017/<project>

   For docker-compose

   config.json: mongo uri mogodb://mongo:

   .evn APP_DIR /usr/src/app

   Dockerfile APP_DIR /usr/src/app

   chaning the default mode to http so that I can start to play with NGINX load balancer.
   Doing work with certificates in NGINX drives a lot of complexity that this test app is just not ready for
